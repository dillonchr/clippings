Two Doc Savage Medallions in Mint condition with paperwork (only 8-10 of these are estimated to exist, all there other are very low grade, these two are the only high condition ones extant). Most sought after of all premiums. Also included is only known complete copy of paperwork (4 page order form). Also in mint condition
The Lone Ranger’s Hollywood Star (One of a kind item). Every Hollywood star recipient receives two stars, the one in stucco and concrete that states on Hollywood Boulevard, and a smaller metal pin that one can take home with them and wear.

In addition to the collection above, the winning bidder also receives the entirety of my book store stock.
 
It has a very LOW RETAIL VALUE of well over one million dollars by iteself. This low estimate is for the store only and does not include the personal collection listed above towards that low estimate. The collection above is worth considerably more by itself.
 
Included in the store are roughly 7000 (500 of which are as yet unlisted) pulp magazines, 300 big little books, 5200 older fiction books from the 1870-1970’s (mostly science fiction and detective), 100 or so random paintings (nothing too valuable here) and over 4000 fiction (non-pulp) magazines. 16,500 items total not including the personal collection listed above. There are about 2400 duplicate items in this number.
 
View my “sellers other items” to see a list. Please note if there is an issue there that is also present in the collection, that means I have more than one. Plenty of very valuable stuff in the store. Examples include:
 
An additional 650 issues of weird tales from 1925-1954. (making over 900 issues total in this auction)
One of three publically known complete sets of Avon's "Murder Mystery Monthy" series.
5 original Canaveral Press First Edition Galley’s for Edgar Rice Burroughs Books.
The only known copy of the first issue of Bedtime Stories
One of only a few existing copies in dustjacket of Uttermost Farthing by R Austin Freeman
About 2/3 of a complete first edition set of H Rider Haggard books in High grade (1870’s-1930’s)
Another 7000 pulp magazines (so you’ll get about 8500 in all). It has the largest stock of pulp magazines of any store in the world.
And so very much more.
 
Altogether between the collection and the store there is roughly 20,000 books in various formats.
 
Please note: as of this time, the ebay store is active, however with any items sold on there, the money is always reinvested into the collection/store. The collection will only grow if unsold. Long story short, if a rare pulp that plugs a hole comes up for sale, or I get the chance to upgrade a book, I will do so. NOTHING will ever be removed from the collection unless I get the chance to upgrade it, in which a higher graded copy of the same book will be present instead.
 
 
Answers to some common questions I’d ask if I was interested the collection:
 
How did you put this together?
Over a long time, with a lot of money and a lot of love.
Some of the lists look a lot like the lists I see doing searches on Wikipedia.
I’ve created or edited a lot of those myself (online only) over the last several years.
What’s the deal with the pictures?
Some of the pictures are bad. Lighting issues. No those “light” lines on the spines of the small press book dustjackets are NOT present on the books, they are just the flash of the camera reacting to the plastic protector. The same with any “light” areas on the bottom center of the pulps in their pictures. The pics that look darker are because the flash did not go off. Those dustjackets are just as bright as if they were new. Almost all hardcover books in the personal collection look brand new, or at the very minimum fine condition.
Why do you show the spines of the small press only?
It’s a massive amount of books. The only way I can show you most of them without taking 2000 pictures is by laying them on their sides. However, in my experience, the first place on a book to be damaged is the top and bottom of the spine of the dustjacket. As you can see most of them, and they look mint in most cases, it should be a good indication to you that the rest of the book and dustjacket that you can’t see are in equally very high grade.
Can I see the collection in person?
Yes. However everything is stored in boxes and it’s a massive amount. Even if you fly in, you won’t be able to see it all even if you stay a week. If you are a serious buyer we can definitely make some sort of arrangement and I can pull out whichever parts hold the most interest to you beforehand to speed things up.
How can these things be in such high grade? Are there any fake dustjackets or facsimile reprint books?
EVERYTHING IS ORIGINAL. They are in such high grade because that’s what I go after. I have bought most of the books in the small press collection (for example) 2-4 times a piece. I love to marry high grade dustjackets to high grade books. I regularly buy the highest graded copy of any book that comes up for sale online from any of a couple dozen different book sites) as well as buy from older collectors with long time private collections. My record for any individual book is having bought it 13 times before finding a very high grade copy. Virtually none of these books came from collections I bought as a dealer. I had to buy them all individually. Most of the books I bought individually several times a piece. I’ve assembled all but one of these sets personally.
Can we talk about this collection over the phone/email?
Sure. Send me an ebay message with your contact info and a good time to be contacted. I can only contact people by phone living in the United States and Canada however.
Are you an under grader or an over grader?
Neither. I try to grade them as they are. I do err on the side of caution however if the book is “on the line”. You will not be upset with the condition of this collection.
Why sell it all at once?
All the great collectors of this sort of stuff; (Ackerman, Moskowitz, Weist, Robinson, etc) sold their world class collections piece by piece individually over time, usually at auction after their deaths. No one has ever sold a collection anything like this all in one go before. The small press sets have never been this high grade or this complete, the pulp magazine collections have never been this rare. This is the literal definition of “once in a lifetime opportunity”. You are looking at the best of the best for Science Fiction and Fantasy Book collections.
Why sell it at all?
I love these books. They are like my right arm. But I can’t take them to the grave. Better to sell them all to a good home that will appreciate a world class book collection when I’m somewhat young, rather than when I’m 80.
Can I buy this if I am out of country?
Yes, but payment will be in full before shipping and you will have to arrange transportation if it if leaves the continental United States. I am not responsible once you (or your agent) leaves my front door with the collection in a truck.
How large is the collection and book store?
Imagine a three car garage completely full from floor to ceiling, front to back without walking room in between, completely full of books. It’s the equivalent of about 350 to 400 “comic long boxes”, and will take the majority of an 18-wheeler for transportation purposes.
Why sell the personal collection and store together?
There is a lot of cross over interest, and frankly if I own even one book after this auction is over, I’ll just end up buying more.
Is everything pictured?
No. About 95% of the small press books from the personal collection are pictured, however only 5% of the rare pulp magazines from the personal collection are pictured, and none of the 18,000 book store items are pictured here, (although you can view those from the last category in my ebay store individually).
